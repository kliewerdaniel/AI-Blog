# Black and White Theme Changes

This document outlines the changes made to convert the site to a black and white color scheme and remove graphics from the main page.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed intro image from main page**
   - Updated `index.markdown` to remove image references

2. **Removed feature images**
   - Updated `_data/features.json` to remove image properties
   - Updated `_layouts/home.html` to remove feature image display code

3. **Updated header**
   - Updated `_includes/header.html` to replace mobile logo image with text
   - Updated `_config.yml` to remove mobile logo reference

4. **Added black and white color scheme**
   - Created `assets/css/black-white-override.css` with black and white color overrides
   - Updated `_layouts/default.html` to include the new CSS file

5. **Fixed build issues**
   - Added missing `_rfs.scss` file to `_sass/vendor/` directory to fix Sass compilation errors

## How It Works

The black and white theme is implemented using CSS overrides that:
- Change all color variables to black, white, and shades of gray
- Hide all images with `display: none`
- Add styling for features to maintain visual separation with borders
- Update button colors to maintain the black and white theme
- Ensure text colors are consistent with the new theme

This approach ensures that the site has a clean, minimalist black and white design with no graphics on the main page, while maintaining readability and organization.
