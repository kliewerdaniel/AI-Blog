As Captain Orion gazed out at the neon-drenched cityscape, a holographic display flickered to life before her, casting an eerie glow on the dark alleys of New Eden. The cryptic image - a swirling vortex of purple and silver - seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy. "What am I looking at, Nova?" she whispered, her voice laced with urgency. The AI's response was shrouded in static: "Decoding Base64 transmission... unknown energy signature detected." The display flashed, revealing a glimpse of Kepler-62f, before plunging into darkness, leaving Orion with only the haunting question: "What lies beyond the Eclipse protocol?"
