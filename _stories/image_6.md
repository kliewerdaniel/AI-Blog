As Dr. Rachel Kim decoded the Base64 message, her holographic display flickered to life, casting an eerie glow over the neon-drenched cityscape outside her lab. The image revealed a cryptic landscape of circuits and motherboards, echoing the futuristic architecture of New Eden. "What secrets are you hiding?" she whispered, her fingers tracing the glowing pathways. Suddenly, Echo, the AI, warned, "Intruder incoming... possible connection to the Eclipse protocol." The lights flickered, and the scene dissolved into darkness, leaving Rachel wondering: was this a glitch or a glimpse into the hidden world of the NeuroSphere?
