As the holographic display flickered to life, Captain Orion's eyes locked onto the decoded image, her mind racing with the implications of the Base64 encoded transmission. "What am I looking at, Elian?" she asked, her voice low and urgent, amidst the neon-drenched cityscape unfolding before them. The technician's fingers danced across the console, enhancing the image of the lost colony on Kepler-62f. A cryptic message emerged: "They're coming..." The captain's grip tightened, as the ship's alarm system wailed, warning of an unknown threat approaching, casting a sense of uncertainty over the high-tech metropolis.
