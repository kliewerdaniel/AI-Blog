As Dr. Rachel Kim's base64 decoder crackled to life, a neon-drenched cityscape materialized, holographic ads swirling like mist. "New Eden's blueprint," she whispered, awe tinged with unease. Elian's voice was laced with curiosity: "The future, hidden in code." EVE, the lab's AI, interrupted, her tone urgent: "Intruder detected, encryption breach imminent..." The screen flickered, distorting the image, hinting at a darker truth beneath the city's glittering facade. As the lab's security protocols kicked in, Rachel wondered: was this a glitch, or a cryptic message from an unknown source, leading her down a perilous path?
