As I gazed out at the neon-drenched cityscape, my comms device crackled to life, echoing the hum of holographic advertisements that lined the streets. "Axel, we've received an encoded transmission," Zephyr whispered urgently, her voice laced with a hint of curiosity. The blurred image on my wrist-mounted console resolved, revealing a Base64 string that unwound like a digital puzzle. "Decoding now," Zephyr said, as the message revealed itself: "Eclipse protocol initiated. Meet me at Club Oni at midnight." The screen flickered, casting an air of uncertainty over the city's futuristic landscape, leaving me wondering what secrets awaited in the shadows of New Eden.
