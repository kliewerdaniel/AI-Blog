As Maya navigated the neon-drenched streets, her comms device crackled with a cryptic message: "NeuroSphere breach imminent. Meet me at New Eden's hub." The holographic ads swirling around her seemed to flicker with an otherworldly energy. She sprinted through the crowded market, the air thick with smoke and ozone, as a mysterious energy signature pulsed in the distance. Suddenly, a blinding flash illuminated the sky, and her comms device transmitted a garbled Base64 code before going dark. The city's lights faltered, plunging Maya into uncertainty, as she wondered: was this the Eclipse protocol unfolding?
