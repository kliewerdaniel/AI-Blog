# Decoding the Neon Night

{% include story-image.html alt="Decoding the Neon Night" src="image_4.JPG" %}

As I gazed out at the neon-drenched cityscape, holographic advertisements flickering like fireflies, Captain Orion's voice crackled over the comms system. "Axel, decode the Base64 string. The Eclipse protocol may be linked to this transmission." The encoded message scrolled across my screen, a puzzle waiting to be solved. I fed it into the decoder, and an image began to take shape - a cryptic map, etched with pulsing circuitry and bioluminescent markers, hinting at a hidden location, perhaps even New Eden. Static interrupted Orion's response, leaving me wondering: what secrets lay hidden in the city's underworld?
