  ```javascript
  const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/annotations/');

  socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    // Handle incoming data
  };

  // Send data
  socket.send(JSON.stringify({ /* data */ }));
  ```

    web: gunicorn backend.wsgi
    ```

  - Add `gunicorn` to `requirements.txt`

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

  - Configure EB environment and deploy using CLI

- **Docker Containers**

  - Create `Dockerfile` and use Docker Compose for multi-container setup

## 9. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 9.1 Functional Testing

#### Backend Tests

- **api/tests.py**

  ```python
  from django.test import TestCase
  from .models import Annotation

  class AnnotationTestCase(TestCase):
      def setUp(self):
          # Initialize test data

      def test_annotation_creation(self):
          # Test code
  ```

- Run tests:

  ```bash
  python manage.py test
  ```

#### Frontend Tests

- **Install Testing Libraries**

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react
  ```

- **Write Tests**

  - **src/components/AnnotationTool.test.js**

    ```javascript
    import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
    import AnnotationTool from './AnnotationTool';

    test('renders AnnotationTool component', () => {
      render(<AnnotationTool />);
      // Add assertions
    });
    ```

### 9.2 Performance Testing

- Use tools like **Locust** for load testing

  ```bash
  pip install locust
  ```

- Define load tests and run against the API endpoints

### 9.3 User Acceptance Testing

- **Beta Testing**

  - Deploy to a staging environment
  - Collect feedback from selected users

- **Surveys and Feedback Forms**

  - Integrate feedback mechanisms into the platform

## 10. Deployment and Maintenance

### 10.1 Preparing for Deployment

- **Security Audit**

  - Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date
  - Run `pip list --outdated` and `npm audit`

- **Code Review**

  - Review code for best practices and optimization

### 10.2 Deploying to Production

- **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines**

  - Use GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins

- **Configure Environment Variables**

  - Use `.env` files or environment variable settings in your hosting platform

- **Database Migration**

  - Apply migrations on the production database

### 10.3 Ongoing Maintenance

- **Monitoring**

  - Implement logging with tools like **Sentry**

- **Regular Updates**

  - Schedule time for dependency updates and feature enhancements

- **Backup Strategy**

  - Regularly backup databases and important files
