# Building an AI-Enhanced Journaling Experience

In this blog post, I explore the integration of AI technologies into personal journaling practices. By leveraging locally hosted language models, we can create a more introspective and insightful journaling experience while maintaining privacy and control over our data.

I discuss the technical challenges and share my journey in developing a platform that combines the simplicity of static site generators with the power of AI.
