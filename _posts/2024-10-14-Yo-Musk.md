## Developing the Persona Capture Application

### Project Setup

**Prerequisites:**

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js and npm**
- **Docker**
- **Git**

**Project Structure:**

```plaintext
persona_capture_app/
├── backend/
├── frontend/
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
```

### Backend Development

#### 1. Setting Up the Django Project

```bash
cd persona_capture_app
django-admin startproject backend
cd backend
python manage.py startapp core
```

#### 2. Installing Dependencies

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install required packages:

```bash
pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers requests
```

Add `'rest_framework'`, `'corsheaders'`, and `'core'` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `backend/settings.py`.

#### 3. Defining the Models

```python
# core/models.py
from django.db import models

class Persona(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    data = models.JSONField()
```

#### 4. Creating Serializers

```python
# core/serializers.py
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Persona

class PersonaSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Persona
        fields = '__all__'
```

#### 5. Developing Views

Implement views to analyze writing samples and generate content:

```python
# core/views.py
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from .serializers import PersonaSerializer
from .models import Persona
from .utils import analyze_writing_sample, generate_content

class AnalyzeWritingSampleView(APIView):
    def post(self, request):
        writing_sample = request.data.get('writing_sample')
        persona = analyze_writing_sample(writing_sample)
        serializer = PersonaSerializer(data={'name': persona['name'], 'data': persona})
        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data)
        return Response(serializer.errors)

class GenerateContentView(APIView):
    def post(self, request):
        persona_id = request.data.get('persona_id')
        prompt = request.data.get('prompt')
        persona = Persona.objects.get(id=persona_id)
        content = generate_content(persona.data, prompt)
        return Response({'content': content})
```

#### 6. Configuring URLs

```python
# backend/urls.py
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/', include('core.urls')),
]

# core/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import AnalyzeWritingSampleView, GenerateContentView

urlpatterns = [
    path('analyze/', AnalyzeWritingSampleView.as_view()),
    path('generate/', GenerateContentView.as_view()),
]
```

### Frontend Development

#### 1. Setting Up the React App

```bash
cd ../
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
npm install axios react-router-dom
```

#### 2. Creating Components

- **UploadSample.js**: Component to upload and submit writing samples.
- **PersonaList.js**: Displays saved personas.
- **GenerateContent.js**: Interface to generate content based on a selected persona.

#### 3. Setting Up Routing

```jsx
// App.js
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import UploadSample from './components/UploadSample';
import PersonaList from './components/PersonaList';
import GenerateContent from './components/GenerateContent';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/upload" component={UploadSample} />
        <Route path="/personas" component={PersonaList} />
        <Route path="/generate" component={GenerateContent} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Integrating LLaMA 3.2 with Ollama and OpenWebUI

#### 1. Setting Up the LLaMA Model

- **Install Ollama**: Follow the installation guide at [Ollama's website](https://ollama.ai).
- **Install OpenWebUI**: Clone the repository and set it up locally.
- **Download LLaMA 3.2 Model**: Obtain the model files and place them in the appropriate directory.

#### 2. Updating the Python Code

```python
# core/utils.py
import requests

def analyze_writing_sample(writing_sample):
    # Interact with the locally hosted LLaMA model
    payload = {'prompt': f"Analyze the following text: {writing_sample}"}
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:11434/api/generate', json=payload)
    return response.json()

def generate_content(persona_data, prompt):
    # Use persona data to generate content
    persona_prompt = f"Write in the style of {persona_data['name']} about {prompt}"
    payload = {'prompt': persona_prompt}
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:11434/api/generate', json=payload)
    return response.json()
```
