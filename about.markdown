On Valentine's Day 2023, my life changed drastically—I found myself homeless, having lost everything I owned. My electronics, phone, wallet, clothes, food, identification papers—everything was taken from me, leaving me with nothing but determination.

Despite the overwhelming circumstances, I refused to give up. With only a set of colored pencils and a notebook, I began to draw. Art became my solace and my voice. I spent my days creating drawings, pouring my heart onto each page. Selling these pieces not only helped me survive but also reignited a spark of hope.

With the money from my drawings, I purchased a basic Tracfone. It was a small step, but it opened doors. I started doing online surveys on the phone, sometimes earning as little as $10 a day. It wasn't much, but every dollar counted. After saving diligently, I eventually had enough to buy a Chromebook.

The Chromebook became a pivotal tool in rebuilding my life. I began working as an independent contractor, assisting with research and contributing to the training of large language models through platforms like Remotasks and OneForma. This work not only provided income but also allowed me to engage with technology—something I'm deeply passionate about.

Investing further in myself, I purchased a domain and hosting services. With these, I built an e-commerce site and ventured into affiliate marketing, blogging, and dropshipping. Each new endeavor taught me valuable skills and moved me closer to stability.

A significant breakthrough came when a job at OneForma allowed me to earn enough for a deposit and moving expenses for a place to call home. Having stable housing was transformative. With a roof over my head, I was able to focus on finding steady employment.

I dedicated hours each day to job applications, seeking any opportunity within walking distance. Persistence paid off when I secured a job. It may not be the most glamorous position, but it provides a steady income and the chance to save for the future.

Today, I've managed to save enough to cover three months of expenses as an emergency fund. I'm now working towards purchasing a new computer, which will enable me to delve deeper into local development of large language models—a hobby that has evolved into a true passion.

**Your support can make a profound difference.**

Every donation brings me one step closer to stability and the ability to contribute more meaningfully to the field of technology. With your help, I can continue this journey of growth and perhaps inspire others facing similar challenges to keep striving for a better future.
